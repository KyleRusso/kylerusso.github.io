  <p><span class="firstcharacter">F</span>rom "The Kick Inside" to "Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)", English singer, songwriter, musician, dancer and producer Kate Bush encapsulates the cultural memory of the 70s and 80s in a way thats hard to find elsewhere.</p>
  <p>We can spend our time praising the masterpeice that was Bush's 1985 album <em>Hounds of Love</em>, surely: the cohesive splendor of this record is like no other. But we can also make sure to note her other works of art. "Babooshka" is a recently revitalized banger. "Suspended in Gaffa" is a delightful bop. "The Man with the Child in His Eyes" Bush wrote when she was just 16. "Wuthering Heights" is a song like no other in that Bush wrote it in a key so odd that no one else would ever dare cover it. Now that's dedication.</p>
  <p>Bush even covers songs better than the original, like her incredible cover of "Rocketman" by Elton John (sorry Elton). Check it out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYSCHKmvcIY" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
  <p>But let's also feign ignorance and talk about <em>Hounds of Love</em>.</p>
  <p>You might've heard it, even if you didn't know it. Kate Bush's disocgraphy is no stranger to visual media: it's been played in TV shows like "Pose" and "The Handmaid's Tale." But even if you haven't heard it at all, you should.</p>
  <p>Bush magically transitions from the "big three" that start off the album (you know the ones) to the second half, all masterful examples of storytelling and an avante-garde genre of pop that still sounds fresh even over 40 years later. It's even more impressive considering the record is entirely self-written, self-performed and self-produced.</p>
  <p>So Kate Bush has her bops, but she also has a distinct image: one of gender-bending and feminism and sharp imagery that percolates into pop culture even today. Her photoshoots and music videos are honestly outmatched.</p>

    <p><em>"I discovered Kate Bush over quarantine. For me, the oblivious optimism combined with the sneaking sense of overwhelming dread that characterized early 2020 came with loads of self-reflecting and desperate attempts to discover a new obsession as the world seemed on the brink of collapse. From those endeavors I found solace in a deep-dive into the music of the past. With the 70s-80s-90s coming back in style there was a certain air of Daliesque whimsicality that the music of that era seemed to bring to the table. Quite literally smack dab in the middle of that energy was none other than Kate Bush.</em></p>
    <p><em>There was just something about her, and it was nice to know that her music could keep me out of my theoretical little pit of despair. Basically, Kate Bush made me feel like I really was running up that hill, even though it was usually the hill in the neighborhood behind my house. But you sure as hell know that I was going to make that deal with God."</em></p>
