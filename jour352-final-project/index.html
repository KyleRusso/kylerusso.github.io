    <p><span class="firstcharacter">I</span>f you’ve been anywhere on the internet within the past few years, you probably know at least something about the treasure trove that is Spotify data visualizers—programs that take your listening history and turn it into embarrassing infographics to share on your Instagram story. And if you were a college student in late 2019, you might remember this name: <a href="https://everynoise.com/everyschool.cgi?root=Harvard%20University&scope=US" target="_blank">Every School at Once</a>.</p>
	<p>The third-party program, filed under the larger web page <a href="https://everynoise.com" target="_blank">Every Noise at Once</a>, claimed to have a specialized Spotify playlist for nearly every college and university around the world, plucked from the very listening history of their students.</p>
	<p>University of California, Berkeley; University of Texas; Harvard University; all had their own special, personal playlists. The University of Maryland, of course, had one too—“The Sound of University of Maryland-College Park.”</p>
	<p>“Crushes and discoveries from University of Maryland-College Park, according to student listening patterns and math,” the description said.</p>
	<p>The playlist revealed thus: As of Nov. 7, community members in College Park were listening to 42% pop music, 27% rap/hip hop, 14% R&B, 10% rock/alternative and 7% dance/electronic. Often, it seems, “student listening patterns and math” translates pretty well to the wider culture of UMD’s campus, though not always, and not always in the way one might expect.</p>

  	<p>If there’s anywhere where music stands out, it’s at one of College Park’s many late-night bars, a popular spot for students across and beyond campus on a Friday, Saturday or even Thursday night.</p>
	<p>Bars take different approaches to playing music, but most, like Terrapin’s Turf and Cornerstone Grill and Loft, hire deejays for weekend nights. It’s up to the deejay’s discretion to mix their tunes, but what results is a cacophony of genres and remixes that keep people up and dancing. Mostly, it’s pop music that tops the playlists.</p>
	<p>From 9:45 p.m. on Nov. 6 to 12:15 a.m. on Nov. 7, Turf’s main star was pop by far, with 57% of the songs. Rap and hip hop music took up 17% of the songs, and dance music took up 11%. From 11:26 p.m. on Nov. 20 to 1:13 a.m. on Nov. 21, Cornerstone’s playlist was mainly pop as well with 52% of the songs, though it sported higher variety with 32% rap and hip hop songs. And Looney’s Pub, another bar down the road, featured a distinctly pop-focused happy hour on Nov. 12, playing 67% pop songs from 7:30 to 8:30 p.m.</p>

    <p>In every instance, students and other bar-goers were beyond hyped to hear the next song come on the speaker. It wasn’t uncommon to hear a collective swell of cheers rise from the crowd as another Katy Perry song started playing, regardless of whether she occupied any space in their listening history.</p>
    <p>What pulls these bars together, then, is the continued dominance of pop music, evident in UMD student listening history. But rap and hip hop’s influence can’t be counted out either. Aidan Appelson, a sophomore biology major and cohost of “CHOPS!” at WMUC Radio, understands that more than most.</p>
	<p>Appelson’s radio show focuses on highlighting the use of samples in music—reusing a portion of existing audio in a new song—a practice that’s commonly used in hip hop and rap music, he said. Even if his listeners don’t realize it, the popular songs they’re listening to probably sample another from years prior. It's the “DNA” of music, as Appelson calls it.</p>
    <p>“I think when you listen to my show, you kind of get a sense of your favorite artist’s favorite artist,” they said.</p>

  	 <p>Above all, Appelson said, “CHOPS!” is a hip hop show, one for which a strong audience exists at UMD.</p>
    <p>“I think the DMV rap scene is very alive,” he said. “It's very strong around here.”</p>
    <p>Other radio shows at WMUC are a mixed bag, some more experimental while others more dedicated to the pop umbrella College Park seems to hold itself under. One of those latter examples is junior journalism major Evan Hecht’s show, “Happy Music for Sad B’s.”</p>
    <p>Hecht’s concept came out of a dislike for sad music and a desire to break from the mold of other shows at WMUC, he said. His genres center chiefly on upbeat pop and disco tunes, featuring the likes of Lady Gaga, Janet Jackson and Donna Summer.</p>  
    <p>“I felt like it was an area WMUC didn’t really cover because in my head, it’s all the pretentious indie kids playing random songs,” Hecht said.</p>

  <div class="large-12 medium-12 small-12 cell" style="margin-top:10px;">
  	<p>When it comes to his show compared to the rest of campus, Hecht considers himself just a bit left of center, he said. He hits all the chart toppers—most recently, Taylor Swift—but finds disconnect in other areas.</p>
    <p>“A lot of the culture on campus, mainly just because we do have a big party culture, is more EDM and hip hop oriented,” Hect said.</p>
 	<p>So while Hecht might connect with friends and other students over Swift’s latest release of "Red (Taylor’s Version)," he might be at a loss over a friend’s excitement for the upcoming Zedd concert.</p>
    <p>Differences aside, though, there’s no denying UMD’s range in musical culture, where a student can go from bopping to “Toxic" by Britney Spears one minute to getting down to “Low” by Flo Rida the very next.</p>
